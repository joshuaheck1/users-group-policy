<p>
- Login into DC-1 via Remote Desktop using the jane_admin account. (mydomain.com\jane_admin and password)

<br />

- Click here --> [SCRIPT](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/AD_PS/blob/master/Generate-Names-Create-Users.ps1) to copy the file we need for the User database as seen in Figure 2.

<p>- Select the icon next to Raw in the top right corner. Copy raw file and go back to PowerShell ISE.</p>
<br />

</p>

<p>- While the thousands of users are being created, take a quick note of the password in the 2nd line of the script. This password is for all the users we are adding. We will need this when we attempt to login as one of the new users.</p>
<br />

</p>

<p>- We should have enough users by now to attempt to login on Client-1 with their credentials.</p>
<p>- Let the script keep running and head to the Start Menu. From here, navigate to Avctive Directory Users and Computers.</p>
<p>- Click OK and select the _EMPLOYEES folder to check out all the users created so far.</p>
<br />

</p>

<p>- Choose a random Username you like and let's use it to login to Client-1.</p>
<p>- I chose bat.raj because... Why not? ðŸ˜‚</p>
<br />

</p>

<p>- Now we will attempt to login to Client-1 with the new user you chose.</p>
<p>- Do not forget to specify domain in username. </p>
<p>- mydomain.com\bat.raj -> Password1. (mydomain.com\username and Password1) </p>
<p>- Did it work? bat.raj had zero issues logging in. ðŸ˜‰ </p>
