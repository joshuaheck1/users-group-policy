</p>

<p>
- Login into DC-1 via Remote Desktop using the jane_admin account. (mydomain.com\jane_admin and password)
<p>- From the Start Menu, type PowerShell in the Search Bar, right-click Windows PowerShell ISE, and Run as Admin.</p>
<br />

<p>

<br />

- Click here --> [SCRIPT](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/AD_PS/blob/master/Generate-Names-Create-Users.ps1) to copy the file we need for the User database as seen in Figure 2.

<p>- Select the icon next to Raw in the top right corner. Copy raw file and go back to PowerShell ISE.</p>
<br />

</p>

<p>- 1. Click the blank page to Create a new file.</p>
<p>- 2. Paste the Script .</p>
<p>- 3. Click the Play button to Run the Script.</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>

<p>- While the thousands of users are being created, take a quick note of the password in the 2nd line of the script. This password is for all the users we are adding. We will need this when we attempt to login as one of the new users.</p>
<br />

<p>
<img width="750" alt="CU5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b87b5323-61dd-4174-af96-995018e43893" />
</p>

<p>- We should have enough users by now to attempt to login on Client-1 with their credentials.</p>
<p>- Let the script keep running and head to the Start Menu. From here, navigate to Avctive Directory Users and Computers.</p>
<p>- Click OK and select the _EMPLOYEES folder to check out all the users created so far.</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>

<p>- Choose a random Username you like and let's use it to login to Client-1.</p>
<p>- I chose bat.raj because... Why not? ðŸ˜‚</p>
<br />

<p>
<img width="750" alt="CU7" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/192c3116-8252-438c-903b-a4067a1cce80" />
</p>

<p>- Now we will attempt to login to Client-1 with the new user you chose.</p>
<p>- Do not forget to specify domain in username. </p>
<p>- mydomain.com\bat.raj and Password1. (mydomain.com\username and Password1) </p>
<p>- Did it work? bat.raj had zero issues logging in. ðŸ˜‰ </p>
<br />

</p>

<p>- Log into DC-1 using jane_admin. (mydomain.com\jane_admin)</p>
<p>- Once logged in, right-click the Start Menu and select Run.</p>
<p>- Type in gpmc.msc and click OK.</p>
<br />

<p>
<img width="750" alt="GP3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62ddd1e6-4715-4a35-960a-b116522a93d4" />
</p>

<p>- Under mydomain.com, right-click Default Domain Policy and select Edit. See Figure 2.</p>
<p>- This will open the Group Policy Management Editor.</p>
<br />


<p>

</p>

<p>- We will need to expand a couple things to find the right path. Here we go. See Figure 3</p>
<p>- In Group Policy Management Editor -> Computer Configuration -> Policies -> Windows Settings -> Security Settings -> Account Policies.</p>
<p>- Now, open Account Lockout Policy.</p>
<br />

<p>
<img width="900" alt="GP6" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cd2af20-a548-4ac7-9645-11bad27e19c8" />
</p>

<p>- Open Account lockout durtion Properties. Check the box by Define the policy, set for 30 minutes, and click Apply and OK. </p>
<br />

<p>
<img width="900" alt="GP7" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44552a31-91f1-42e5-ac6c-a4881d0ebca0" />
</p>

<p>- Notice the Suggested Value Changes based off our lockout duration. </p>
<p>- We want this, so simply click OK. </p>
<br />

<p>
<img width="900" alt="GP8" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f6d968b-2ba2-438a-b546-e4d0da50014a" />
</p>

<p>- We can confirm the details of our updated Account Lockout Policy here. </p>
<p>- I think this takes almost 90 minutes to take effect, but we are not waiting that long because we got stuff to do. </p>
<p>- Next, we will force update the policy so the changes take effect now.</p>
<br />

</p>

<p>- Jump over to Client-1 and log in as jane_admin. (mydomain.com\jane_admin) </p>
<p>- Open Command Prompt, enter the command gpupdate /force  and press enter.</p>
<p>- Once the force update is complete, log out of Client-1.</p>
